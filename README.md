A jquery frontend quiz app completed for the bloc.io bootcamp

Designed to be cloned to a local directory  and accessed via a browser file:///*clonedirectory*/quizzical/index.html (replace *clonedirectory* with the path to your local folder)

For all screensizes down to 400px width

No support is offered on this project and it is not maintained

Unit testing and an Express backend will be added after I complete the bootcamp
